KCC Database â€“ SQL Learning Project

This repository contains my SQL practice files based on the KCC sample database.
The database is designed for learning SQL concepts, focusing on data reporting and analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Database Design

The KCC database consists of 4 main tables:

Customers â†’ Stores customer details.

Orders â†’ Tracks customer orders.

Order_Products â†’ Links orders with products.

Products â†’ Stores product information.

The tables are connected using primary keys and foreign keys to form a relational database.

ðŸ“– SQL Concepts Practiced

Explored the Customers table.

Practiced joins between Customers and Orders to analyze order details.

Worked on filtering data using WHERE, OR, BETWEEN, AND, DISTINCT, IN, NOT IN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY.

Worked on functions- SUM(), DATEADD(), GETDATE(), COUNT()

Learned about relationships between tables and how to retrieve meaningful insights.
