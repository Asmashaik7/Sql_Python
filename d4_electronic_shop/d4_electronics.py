#Day 4 Assignment: Analyze Sales Data from a CSV
#You're working for a small shop that sells electronics. They give you a CSV file with daily sales records.
#1. Create a CSV file d4_sales.csv. It should contain at least 6 rows with this structure:
#product	units_sold	price_per_unit
#2. Read from d4_sales.csv and compute:
#ðŸ”¸ Total revenue = units Ã— price
#ðŸ”¸ Total revenue of the shop (sum of all)
#ðŸ”¸ List the product(s) with revenue > 50,000
#3. Add a new column status
#If revenue â‰¥ 50,000 â†’ "High"
#Else â†’ "Normal"
#Save this into a new file: d4_sales_updated.csv
#Bonus:Try exporting this to a SQLite database table (if you're feeling confident!)
