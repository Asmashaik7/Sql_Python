📊 Statistics & Hypothesis Testing – Learning Summary

This folder contains my notes, practice notebooks, and case studies covering all essential topics in Statistics for Data Analysis.
These concepts are widely used in data analytics, machine learning, and decision-making.

🔶 1. Descriptive Statistics
Measures of Central Tendency
Concept	Meaning	Pandas Code
Mean	Average value	df['col'].mean()
Median	Middle value after sorting	df['col'].median()
Mode	Most frequent value	df['col'].mode()[0]
Measures of Dispersion
Concept	Meaning	Pandas Code
Range	Max − Min	df['col'].max() - df['col'].min()
Variance	Average squared distance from mean	df['col'].var()
Standard Deviation	√Variance (spread of data)	df['col'].std()
🔶 2. Probability Concepts

Random Variables

Events and Outcomes

Sampling and Population

Probability Distributions (Normal distribution basics)

🔶 3. Hypothesis Testing
Null & Alternative Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis (H₀): No effect, no difference

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is an effect/difference

Significance Level (α)

Common value: 0.05

Chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

Type I & Type II Errors
Error	Meaning
Type I Error (False Positive): Rejecting a true H₀	
Type II Error (False Negative): Not rejecting a false H₀	
🔶 4. Hypothesis Tests
Z-Test

Used when:

Population variance known OR sample size > 30

Tests mean differences

T-Test

Used when:

Population variance unknown

Sample size < 30

More realistic for real-world data

Chi-Square Test

Used for:

Categorical data

Testing relationship between variables

Goodness of fit

🔶 5. Correlation Analysis

Measures the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables.

Range: −1 to +1

+1 → strong positive

−1 → strong negative

0 → no relationship

Pandas:

df.corr()

🔶 6. Linear Regression

Used to predict one value based on another.

Simple Linear Regression

Formula:
y = m x + c

Where:

x = independent variable

y = dependent variable

m = slope

c = intercept

Used for forecasting and trend analysis.

🔶 7. Included in This Folder

Jupyter Notebooks for all topics

Case studies with code

Notes summarizing every concept in simple language

Visualizations for regression & correlation

⭐ About This Learning

This folder reflects my understanding of statistical concepts used in Data Analysis.
I practiced each topic with real datasets, recreated examples from recordings, and wrote explanations in simple language to ensure I fully understood the concepts.
