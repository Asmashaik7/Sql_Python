## Quick Example â€” Customers & Orders
**Tables**

`customer`:

| c_id | name    |
|------|---------|
| 1    | Alice   |
| 2    | Bob     |
| 3    | Charlie |
| 4    | David   |

`orders`:

| o_id | c_id | amount |
|------|------|--------|
| 101  | 1    | 500    |
| 102  | 1    | 700    |
| 103  | 2    | 300    |
| 104  | 5    | 900    |  <-- order with no matching customer


### 1) INNER JOIN â€” only common rows
```sql
SELECT c.c_id, c.name, o.o_id, o.amount
FROM customer c
INNER JOIN orders o
  ON c.c_id = o.c_id;
```
**Result**: rows for Alice (101,102) and Bob (103). No Charlie or order 104.


### 2) LEFT JOIN â€” all from left (customers)
```sql
SELECT c.c_id, c.name, o.o_id, o.amount
FROM customer c
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON c.c_id = o.c_id;
```
**Result**: all customers; customers without orders show `NULL` for order columns (Charlie, David).


### 3) RIGHT JOIN â€” all from right (orders)
```sql
SELECT c.c_id, c.name, o.o_id, o.amount
FROM customer c
RIGHT JOIN orders o
  ON c.c_id = o.c_id;
```
**Result**: all orders; orders without matching customer show `NULL` for customer columns (o_id 104).


### 4) FULL OUTER JOIN â€” everything from both
```sql
SELECT c.c_id, c.name, o.o_id, o.amount
FROM customer c
FULL JOIN orders o
  ON c.c_id = o.c_id;
```
**Result**: matching rows, plus left-only (customers with no orders) and right-only (orders with no customer).

## Advanced Examples
- **Self-join (employees and managers):** useful when the same table references itself.
- **Multiple join conditions:** use `ON a.id = b.id AND a.type = b.type` for stricter matching.
- **JOIN + GROUP BY:** aggregate after joining to get per-customer totals.

**Example â€” total amount per customer (including customers with zero orders):**

```sql
SELECT c.c_id, c.name, COALESCE(SUM(o.amount), 0) AS total_amount
FROM customer c
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON c.c_id = o.c_id
GROUP BY c.c_id, c.name;
```

## Common Mistakes & Tips
- Forgetting to include the `ON` clause â€” causes cross join behavior.
- Confusing `WHERE` filtering after an OUTER JOIN â€” applying `WHERE o.o_id IS NOT NULL` turns a LEFT JOIN into an INNER-like result.
- Not using table aliases â€” aliases (`c`, `o`) make queries clearer in multi-join queries.
- Using `FULL JOIN` in DB engines that donâ€™t support it (MySQL prior to 8.x) â€” emulate using `UNION` of LEFT and RIGHT joins.

---

## Quick Reference
- `INNER JOIN`: only matching rows
- `LEFT JOIN`: all left, matched right
- `RIGHT JOIN`: all right, matched left
- `FULL JOIN`: all rows from both
