✅ Already Practiced:
You’ve done great work on these:

SELECT, WHERE, AND/OR, IN, BETWEEN

DISTINCT, ORDER BY

Aggregates: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()

GROUP BY, HAVING — you're strong in this now!

Multiple GROUP BY columns ✔️

Conditions on aggregates (e.g., HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2)

🚧 Still To Practice (Essential Topics):
Let’s now work on these step-by-step from beginner to real-world use:

🔸 1. ALTER TABLE
Add a new column

Modify column datatype

Rename a column

Drop a column

🔸 2. JOINS (🔥 very important for interviews & real projects)
INNER JOIN

LEFT JOIN

RIGHT JOIN

FULL OUTER JOIN

JOIN with multiple conditions

Self Join (optional)

JOIN + GROUP BY together (advanced)

🔸 3. Subqueries
Subqueries in WHERE

Subqueries in FROM

Correlated Subqueries (optional but useful)

🔸 4. UNION / UNION ALL
🔸 5. CASE WHEN
Conditional columns (e.g., Salary band)

🔸 6. String Functions
UPPER(), LOWER(), SUBSTR(), CONCAT(), LENGTH()

🔸 7. Date Functions
CURRENT_DATE, DATE_SUB(), DATEDIFF(), etc.

🔸 8. SET operations (Optional)
INTERSECT, EXCEPT

can you tell me how much percent i covered and how much left to learn
