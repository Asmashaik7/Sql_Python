-- What does GROUP BY do?
-- It groups rows that have the same values in one or more columns, so that we can apply aggregate functions like:

-- SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN()

 WHEN do you use GROUP BY?
üëâ Rule:
--If you're using an aggregate function (like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN) and you want the result per group, you MUST use GROUP BY.

üí° Quick Tip:
Only use parentheses in IN (), VALUES (), or subqueries ‚Äî not in GROUP BY.

SELECT department, location, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 90000
GROUP BY department, location
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;

GROUP BY department, location
This tells SQL:

‚ÄúGroup the data separately for each unique combination of department and location.‚Äù

üîé Visual:
department	location	emp_name
IT	Chennai	A
IT	Chennai	B
IT	Mumbai	C

If you do GROUP BY department, location:

One group is: IT + Chennai

Another group is: IT + Mumbai

--Example 1: Group by category to get total quantity sold

SELECT category, SUM(quantity) AS total_qty
FROM sales
GROUP BY category;

--Example 2: Group by product and show average price

SELECT product, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;
