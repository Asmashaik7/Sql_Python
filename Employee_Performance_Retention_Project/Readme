## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding & Initial Exploration
- Loaded the dataset and reviewed its structure
- Checked data types and column distributions
- Identified missing values and data quality issues

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing values:
  - `education` imputed using mode
  - `previous_year_rating` imputed using median
- Validated data consistency

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Performance Analysis
- Analyzed KPI achievement, training scores, and ratings
- Compared performance across departments, age groups, and education levels
- Evaluated the impact of training on performance

#### Retention Trend Analysis (Using Proxies)
- Used `length_of_service` as a proxy for retention
- Studied retention trends based on ratings, KPIs, awards, and age groups
- Identified higher attrition risk among early-career employees

#### Relationship Analysis
- Examined relationships between training effectiveness, performance, and retention
- Identified department-level performance and retention patterns

## 💡 Key Insights
- Employees with higher training scores are more likely to meet KPIs.
- Award-winning employees tend to have longer tenure.
- Early-career employees show higher retention risk.
- Performance and retention patterns vary significantly across departments.

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Strengthen department-specific and targeted training programs.
- Introduce structured onboarding and mentorship for early-career employees.
