# SQL + Python Practice Projects

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my **SQL and Python learning journey**, combining **hands-on practice projects, real-world case studies, and statistics-based analysis**.  
All projects are built step-by-step with the help of **Generative AI (ChatGPT / Codey)**, focusing on **understanding and logic building rather than copy-pasting code**.

The repository contains a **mix of practice exercises, database projects, and analytical case studies**, reflecting continuous learning and applied problem-solving using SQL, Python, and data analysis concepts.
