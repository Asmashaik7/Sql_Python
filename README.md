🐍 SQL + Python Practice Projects
📌 Overview

This repository contains my SQL and Python practice projects, built step-by-step with the help of Generative AI (ChatGPT/Codey). Each project focuses on hands-on learning by solving real-world style problems — from managing students and courses to building simple trackers and management systems.

The repo documents my learning journey, where I practiced coding by writing everything manually instead of copy-pasting, to strengthen my logic, SQL queries, and Python skills.

📂 Repository Structure

cars_owners_project/ – Vehicle and owner tracking system

d5_library_book_management_system/ – Library system (borrowing & returning)

d6_school_management/ – School management database + Python interface

d7_stud_course_enrollment_project/ – Student course enrollment (SQL + Python integration)

d8_company_project_tracker/ – Project tracking system for employees

sql_queries_cgpt/ – SQL query practice tasks

sqlite/ – SQLite database files for testing

studentmarks_usingsql/ – SQL-based student marks analysis

🛠️ Skills Practiced

SQL – SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, aggregation queries
Python – database connections, CRUD operations, logic building, file handling
Problem Solving – breaking down real-world scenarios into database + Python solutions
Hands-On Practice – writing queries and code manually for better understanding

✨ Key Takeaways

Strengthened SQL query writing and debugging skills
Learned how to connect SQL with Python for small projects
Practiced real-world scenarios like student enrollment, library management, and company tracking

Note: This is an **ongoing learning repository** — I will continue adding new SQL and Python practice programs as I progress.



Built confidence in writing code by hand and iterating with AI guidance

👉 This repo reflects my learning journey with SQL + Python using AI as a coding partner, focusing on practice, understanding, and project-based learning.
