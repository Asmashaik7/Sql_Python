** Chinook SQL Analysis**
** Overview**

This project involves SQL-based analysis of the Chinook database, a sample music store database.
I worked on this project as part of my SQL practice during Internshala training, focusing on writing structured queries to analyze business-related questions using real relational data.

The project demonstrates my ability to work with multi-table databases, apply analytical SQL concepts, and extract meaningful insights.

** Objectives**

* Practice querying a relational database using SQL

* Strengthen understanding of joins, subqueries, and aggregations

* Answer business-style questions from transactional data

* Build confidence in writing clean and readable SQL queries

** Dataset**

* Database: Chinook (Music Store Database)

* Domain: Digital music sales

**Key tables used:**

- Customer

- Invoice & InvoiceLine

- Track

- Album

- Artist

- Genre

- Employee

**SQL Concepts Used**

* SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY

* INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN

* GROUP BY, HAVING

* Subqueries

* Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)

* Window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK)

* Views and calculated fields

**Analysis Performed**

* Customer and sales analysis

* Revenue contribution by artist, album, and genre

* Top-selling tracks and artists

* Customer purchase behavior

* Ranking queries using window functions

**Project Files**

This project includes multiple SQL files covering different concepts:

- Core database queries

- Practice questions

- Subqueries and views

- Ranking and analytical queries

**Key Takeaway**

This project strengthened my ability to analyze real-world relational data using SQL and improved my confidence in writing queries that answer business-driven questions.

**Note:** ChinookDB.sql is used to initialize the database schema and seed data. Analysis queries are maintained in separate SQL files.
