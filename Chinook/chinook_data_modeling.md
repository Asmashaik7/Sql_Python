## Recommended Insert Order in Chinook ##

Here’s the safe sequence to follow:

**Order Table**
1. 	**Genre**			Base category, no dependencies
2. 	**MediaType**		Also independent
3. 	**Artist**			Parent for Album
4. 	**Album**			Depends on Artist
5. 	**Track**			Depends on Album, Genre, MediaType
6.	**Employee**		Parent for Customer
7.	**Customer**		Depends on Employee
8.	**Invoice**			Depends on Customer
9.	**InvoiceLine**		Depends on Invoice & Track
10.	**Playlist**		Independent
11.	**PlaylistTrack**	Depends on Playlist & Track

           ├── MediaType
           ├── Genre
           ├── InvoiceLine

### What is Data Modeling? ###

Data Modeling is the process of designing how data will be stored, related, and organized in your database.
There are 3 levels of it 
**1️⃣ Conceptual Data Model (High-level plan)**
Focus: What entities (tables) exist and how they’re related.
You only talk about entities (like Artist, Album, Track, Customer).
You show relationships (like Artist → Album = One-to-Many).

Example:
Artist → Album → Track
Customer → Invoice → InvoiceLine
You can draw this as a simple ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram — no SQL yet.

**2️⃣ Logical Data Model (Structure planning)**
Focus: What attributes (columns) each table will have and their data types.
Still no real database yet — just planning.
You decide:
What’s the Primary Key
What’s the Foreign Key
What are relationships (1–1, 1–many, many–many)
What columns belong to each entity

Example:
Album table → AlbumId (PK), Title, ArtistId (FK)

**3️⃣ Physical Data Model (Implementation in SQL)**
Focus: Actually creating everything in SQL Server.
You write commands like:
CREATE TABLE
ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT..
