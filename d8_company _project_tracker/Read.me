üíº Project Title: Company Project Tracker
üìö Scenario:
You are building a small system to track which employees are working on which projects in a company.

üìÇ Tables to Create:
1. employees
Column Name	Type
emp_id	INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
name	TEXT
department	TEXT

2. projects
Column Name	Type
project_id	INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
project_name	TEXT
budget	INTEGER

3. employee_projects
Column Name	Type
emp_id	INTEGER (FK)
project_id	INTEGER (FK)
hours_allocated	INTEGER

‚úÖ Assignment Tasks:
Step 1: Table Creation
Create all three tables.

Use foreign keys appropriately in employee_projects.

Step 2: Insert Data
Add 5 employees, 3 projects, and map them using employee_projects (min 2 projects per employee, multiple employees per project allowed).

Step 3: Python Menu System
Implement a CLI menu with the following options:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
1. Show all employees
2. Show all projects
3. Show all employee-project assignments
4. Search projects by employee name
5. Add new employee
6. Assign employee to a project
7. Exit
üí° Hints for Implementation:
For Option 3, use JOIN across the three tables.

For Option 4, take employee name input and display their project names and hours.

For Option 6, let user pick emp_id, project_id, and hours_allocated.

üèÅ Bonus Tasks (Optional):
Department-wise Project Hours Summary
Show total hours_allocated for each department using JOIN + GROUP BY.

Top Project by Budget
Show project with highest budget.

Employee with Most Hours Assigned
Show employee name and total hours.

‚úÖ Submission Criteria:
All SQL code should be in your Python script using sqlite3.

Modularize code (functions for each menu option).

Use clear input/output formatting.
